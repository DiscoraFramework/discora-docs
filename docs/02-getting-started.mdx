## Basics

The Discora framework consists of a client, a loader, and handlers. This concept is simple and designed for easy contribution and extension.

The Discora framework consists of a client, a loader, and handlers. This concept is very simple and not too complicated. It is designed this way so developers can contribute and add other concepts to make Discora even better.

**DiscoraClient:** is a class that extends the Discord.js Client class adding features such as loading commands and events using a specfic type loader

**Loader**: The loader reads your commands and events files, there are currently two types of loaders availble

- `flat` - Loads the typescript and javascript files on the top level it does not load files within folders

- `recursive` - Loads files and files nested within folders. It will load all the files within the commands directory, regardless of how deeply they are nested

**Handlers:** Handlers are specifically used in slash commands. They help manage interactions that aren't traditional chat input commands but are still connected to a particular command.

_These are the three concepts that makes Discora, and we will explore them further in this documention._
