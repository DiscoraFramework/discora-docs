# Intro  

**Discora** makes Discord bot development easier by handling commands and events for you. Instead of setting up everything manually, just run the CLI and start building.  

```bash
npx create-discora@latest
```  

## Common Challenges in Discord Bot Development  

🚧 **Complex Setup** – Setting up commands and events from scratch can be tedious and repetitive.  

🔄 **Messy Event Logic** – Without a clear structure, managing events can quickly become unorganized.  

🧠 **Steep Learning Curve** – Getting started with Node.js and Discord.js can feel overwhelming.  

🐞 **Hard to Debug** – Troubleshooting issues is more difficult when the code is all over the place.  

## How Discora Helps  

💡 **Open-Source & Community-Driven** – We want the community to be involved in making bot development easier for everyone.  

🛠 **Cleaner & More Organized** – Keeps your commands and events structured, so your bot is easier to maintain.  

⚡ **TypeScript Support** – Helps catch errors early and improves code reliability.  

🚀 **Proven in Production** – It’s been tested in real projects, so you can count on it to work.  

## Built on Discord.js  
Discora is built on top of Discord.js, meaning you get all the power and flexibility of Discord.js while working with a more structured and developer-friendly setup. You still have access to all the familiar APIs and methods, but with added simplicity and organization. This makes it easier to scale your bot, maintain clean code, and take advantage of everything Discord.js has to offer without the usual setup hassle.
