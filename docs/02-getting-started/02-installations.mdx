For an easier setup, use the **Discora CLI** to generate the necessary files automatically:  

```bash
npx create-discora@latest
```  

This will guide you through the setup process and create the required project structure.  

## Manual Installation  

If you prefer to install **Discora** manually, you can do so with **npm**, **yarn**, or **pnpm**:  

#### Using npm:  
```bash
npm install discora
```  

#### Using yarn:  
```bash
yarn add discora
```  

#### Using pnpm:  
```bash
pnpm add discora
```  

Check the **Setup Guide** for instructions on configuring Discora manually in your project.
